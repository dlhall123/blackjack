# blackjack

This is a simple blackjack game.

The first user entry screen allows the user to input the number of decks, the bankroll amount, and the starting bet amount.  If the user does not enter these values, a default will be used as specified.

once that information is entered, the actual game begins.

The game provides the "normal rules" and pays for blackjack, with the player being allowed to:
- hit
- stand
- double down (any first 2 cards, except blackjack
- split the hand (two initial cards have the same value)
- take insurance/even money (when the dealer's up card is an Ace)

# Future Improvements

- make Split so that a player can take more cards after the initial hand split
