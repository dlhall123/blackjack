# blackjack

This is a simple blackjack game.

The first user entry screen allows the user to input the number of decks, the bankroll amount, and the starting bet amount.  If the user does not enter these values, a default will be used as specified.

once that information is entered, the actual game begins.

The game provides the "normal rules" and pays for blackjack, with the player being allowed to hit, stand, double down, or split the hand (doubling and splitting only allowed during the appropriate situations).
